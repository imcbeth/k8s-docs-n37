# Homelab TODO & Improvements

## ✅ **Recently Completed** (December 2025 - March 2026)

### Infrastructure Fixes (January 2026)

- **Tigera Operator Migration** - Migrated Calico CNI to GitOps-managed Tigera operator (PRs #346-352, 2026-01-30)
  - Calico now managed by Tigera operator in calico-system namespace
  - ArgoCD Application with multi-source (operator from GitHub, Installation CR from homelab)
  - Typha topology spread constraints for node distribution
  - Established ignoreDifferences patterns for operator-managed resources
  - ArgoCD repo-server memory increased to 512Mi for large manifest generation
- **External-DNS Domain Filter Fix** - Fixed subdomain zone filtering (PRs #295-296, 2026-01-25)
  - Root cause: `--domain-filter=k8s.n37.ca` rejected the `n37.ca` Cloudflare zone
  - Solution: Use parent zone as domain-filter; ingresses specify exact hostnames
- **Grafana fsGroup Race Condition** - Fixed mount failure with Synology CSI (PR #298, 2026-01-25)

## 📋 **Notes**

- **Resource Constraints:** All implementations must consider the Pi 5 cluster constraints (80GB RAM total, 20 ARM cores)
- **Testing Strategy:** Test all implementations in a development namespace before production deployment
- **Documentation First:** Document all configurations and procedures for maintainability in this docs site
- **GitOps Workflow:** All changes must go through PR workflow in the homelab repository
- **Regular Reviews:** Review and update this TODO list monthly based on cluster evolution
- **Monitoring First:** Ensure monitoring is in place before deploying new workloads
